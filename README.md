# MMartinMarin tattoo

This project is a portfolio/information website for my cousin who is a tattoo artist.

My main idea was for everyone to be able to see his work and to know a bit more about him. ------

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

## UX

1. The main idea of the project to show the user how the artist works, to give a bit of an insight and to maybe know a bit more about him and his story.

2. On the main page you can see a regular picture, but the idea behind it is for people to see his care when working.
Some people may just see a picture of someone doing a tattoo. Others, like me, see an artist that takes care of his customers by giving them a safe environment. How? You may ask, well, he is wearing face mask and gloves. As a customer, this gives me a good and safe feeling.

2. Then we see how long he's being doing this for, also we are again reassured about his standard by seeing a phrase and a logo that attracts people (Highest quality products and gloves logo). Also people's testimonials.

3. As you go along the website, you learn about his story and the way the artist thinks. This will be engaging for the customer and they may feel like they know more of the artist even if they never met. They will see his work in great detail and there will be information about the place with a map view.

***---Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.---***

## Features


In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

### Existing Features
- Navbar - allows users to go throughout the website.

- Home link - Allows you to go to the home page where you find an overview of the artist.

- The logo - Original just a logo but also leads you to the home page.

- About me - Allows the user to know about the artist by reading about his journey and his way of thinking. Also showing a picture of him working.

- My work - Gives an insight of the different tattoos he has done.
  -Slide show work- Instead of having multiple pictures, the customer can see one by one the pictures with a quote by the artist and the date the tattoo was made on.

- Contact - The customer will be able to send a message/enquery about future works or send feedbacks. Also they'll be able to see the address and location of the place.

- Flags - (English and Spanish) The artist in based in Spain, this allows people to view the website in both languages. Makes it national and international.

- Social media logos - This allows the user to go to the different social medias the artist uses, his main page that is Instagram and then youtube where you can find videos about his processes when doing a tattoo.

*** - For the future I would like to add a facts tips/facts page.
- Adding a sign up link, for the people that have done or will do tattoos with Martin.
- Add a time line about his work journey.
- Information about health and safety***

***- Navbar - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:***

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
